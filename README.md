# ALU by verilog

A ALU Multiplier in verilog, run on Modelsim
> 32-bits AND, OR, ADD, SUB, SLT，以Full-Adder做起並以Ripple-Carry的進位方式連接32個1-Bit ALU Bit Slice，使之變為32-bits ALU。 

# GetToken by c++

Get input token and turn into a binary tree,then print the tree

Because the project was design for file read,so when encounter end-of-line, the process will print result of "a token" in manual input, not read whole input
if needed, type "space" between tokens

# Heap by c++

A max heap to collect data of universities
> enter condition to filter object

A min-max heap to collect data of universities
> enter condition to filter object
> Top-K maximums from min-max heap

# Maze by c++

Simulate Maze-Solving, using DFS stratagy
> can handle multi-goals  
> track shortest path

# PageReplacement by python

A page replacement algorithm
> First in First out
> Least Recently Used
> Most Frequently Used
> Least Frequently Used
> Additional Reference bits
> Second Chance
